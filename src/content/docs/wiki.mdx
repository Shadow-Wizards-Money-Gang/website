## Performance Optimizations
For the best experience, allocate between 4 and 8 GB of RAM to the modpack. Adjusting to 8 GB (8192 MiB) for both minimum and maximum memory can resolve most lag issues.

### Recommended Java Version
- **Java 23**: [Download it here](https://adoptium.net/es/temurin/releases/?version=23) or any version above Java 17.  
- Using an updated Java version can significantly improve game performance.

### Configuring Prism Launcher
- **Java Settings**: Set your Java version to 22 or 23 to maximize performance.
- **Disable Compatibility Checks**: Go to Launcher Settings > Java, and uncheck "Skip Java compatibility checks."

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

:::caution[Rendering Issues]
Certain visual effects, like fog rendering, may not display correctly with shaders or distant horizons mods. This does not impact gameplay functionality.

In some cases, the installation GUI may not appear on Linux systems, though you can still interact with it. If needed, please reach out on our Discord for support.

:::note[Crouching Issues]
Occasionally, keybindings for crouching may not work as expected. The default settings should function correctly—if you encounter issues, try resetting keybinds in the control settings.
