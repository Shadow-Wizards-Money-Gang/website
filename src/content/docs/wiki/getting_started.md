In the world of Shadow Wizards, a modified form of progression is used, with different tools and threats then vanilla. Progression and survival is detailed here

**What are stats and how are they used?**
 Stats are a new system inspired by games such as Dark Souls or Elden Ring. Stat levels are created from XP. After you get enough XP, you may convert it into a stat point which can then be used to purchase a desired stat (check your keybinds for the key). This system encourages people to develop classes, encouraging adventure parties for more dangerious expeditions. In addition, certain resources can only be made by certain classes, to encourage interaction and specialisation.
Stat levels will both be able to determine what items and even altars you may use, as well as passive stats such as your max health or speed. The stats we use are listed below an what they correspond to:

- **BOD**: Body. BOD determines your max health, raw damage, and even the size of your model! BOD often relates to being able to use heavy, stronger gear such as large swords and platemail.
- **DEX**: Dexterity. DEX determines your speed and agility. High enough DEX will even unlock parkour! DEX is often used by rogue or ranger type classes, such as one's ability to use graceful, finess-based weapons such as rapiers, daggers, or bows.
- **INT**: Intelligence. INT determines one's proficiency in magics of all sorts. Mages will often need higher INT to fully unlock their potential in arcane arts.
- **FAI**: Faith. FAI determines your skills in utilising the divine powers of the gods, even if you do not know their name. This often relates to healing or smiting incantations. In addition, if you have at least 1 point of FAI, you can offer up **Devotion** at **Praying Altars**. The higher FAI you have, the more Devotion you can offer. Devotion is used to both create holy objects and books, as well as to perform Blessings.
- **OCC**: Occult. OCC determines your proficiency in hidden arts such as alchemy, as well as your ability to use various relics, often found in structures or in the hands of mysterious traders. In addition, OCC will improve your resistance to negative effects of potions.
- **WIS**: Wisdom. WIS determines your ability to tap into nature itself, and is often utilised by druids or similar. High enough WIS will also allow you to control various beasts!

**Undead mobs are a lot harder to kill, how do I handle them?**
In order to make undeads more of a threat, we have Consecration. This causes undeads to be resistant to most forms of damage other than **fire** and **holy**. This type of damage can be obtained early-game by creating greases, with Firegrease being available to anyone early on. Apply a grease to a weapon in your inventory by having the grease selected and then right-clicking on the weapon with it. It has a limited life but will get the job done.

**How do I obtain resin for greases?**
Resin can be obtained by using a hoe on any living log. This will put a slash on the log and it will ooze out Resin items for a specific time, before it breaks. The rare Arrayan trees, however, will not break after they've been slashed. In addition, Resin can be created by holding an Oak Sapling in one hand and a Pestle in the other, and r-clicking on a Mortar with it.

**How do I obtain White Ash?**
 White Ash is a special reagent that can be applied to weapons much like any Grease. It comes from having lightening strike an Arrayan tree.

**How does gear work?**
Gear, both in progression tiers and function, is changed significantly from vanilla progression. For example, there is no gold, diamond, or netherite. To see all changes, check the "[Equipment](/wiki/equipment/)" page.

**How does progression work?**
As said above, SWMG uses its own form of progression and its own form of gear. Basic armour is covered by SWMG, while specific armour for classes (with a few exceptions), is handled by the respective mod, i.e. if you wish to progress though DEX, you should look into Archers or Rogues & Warriors.

**How does negative effect building work?**
Negative effects apply a sort of "threshold" of the effect building before they actually apply. This means you will have to get exposed to the source of a negative effect for a certain amount of time/certain amount of hits before the effect is actually applied. This is represented by the bars on the top left that show the effect icon.

**If there is no Nether or End, how do I obtain certain resources?**
 Many of the previously Nether-locked resources, such as Brewart (Netherwart) or Phlogistonic Powder (Blaze Powder) are now created by **Alchemy**, see that page for a full list. Some, however, no longer exist due to balancing reasons, such as Netherite and Elytra. 
 Later, higher end gear will instead be tied to Aylyth, such as Esstline (Netherite) gear from the RPG series. Aylyth will be added in a future update, so keep your eyes peeled!
