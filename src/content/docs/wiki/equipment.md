title: Equipment
description: Gear, weapons, and progression
---
In Shadow Wizards, armour and weapons progression is different than vanilla. Below is the summary and function of all.

---
Overview
---------
<br>
With a few key exceptions, durability does not exist in the pack. In addition, each piece of gear can have a max of 2 enchantments, however not all enchantments are available.

Armour
---------
<br>

**Standard Armour**
<br>Rather than the typical leather-chain-iron-diamond-netherite tiers for armour, SWMG uses its own tiers. Check EMI for crafting! In addition, enemies may drop their armour and it may also be found as loot.

- **Gamberson**: Made of leather the same way vanilla leather is armour is made. In addition, animals drop more leather than normal and various enemies will also drop leather.
- **Chainmail**: Made of chain and iron nuggets applied to the respective gamberson piece
- **Light Platemail**: Made by surrounding the respective chain with iron ingots.
- **Platemail**: Only offered as a trade by high-end Armoursmith villagers
- **Maximillian**: Currently unobtainable by normal means, but may be dropped by Fallen Knights.

A thing to note is that while anyone can wear the above, it might have some drawbacks. Those with insufficient BOD will find themselves slowed by stronger tiers, and the casting power of mages will decrease with higher tiers also.


**Other Armour**
<br>SWMG adds some additional armour
- **Bone Armour**: Currently unobtainable, will be created from Hefty Beast Bones. A lighter armour that increases speed and has no other drawbacks.
- **Liannar Armour**: Currently unobtainable, created specifically for battlemages. Liannar is a scared material that offers protection but does not weaken spells.
- **Other Mods**: Mods such as RPG Wizards, RPG Paladins & Priests, etc also add their own armour. However many of it has stat requirements.

Weapons
---------
<br>

Weapons are, for the most part, largely unchanged other than certain types having stat requirements, such as claymores needing BOD or magic staves needing INT.

**Greases**
<br>
Grease can be applied to weapons, which will impart a specific effect on them based on the grease used. Grease however will wear off after so long, and will need to be re-applied. Apply grease to weapons by opening your inventory, clicking on the grease, then r-clicking on the weapon to apply it to.
<br> White Ash functions the same way as greases, and is applied in the same way.

Shields
---------
<br>
There are 2 major types of shields to be aware of, standard (vanilla) shields, and buckler shields. 
<br> Standard shields require BOD to use efficiently, while bucklers do not. However, bucklers function in a different way, focusing on deflecting projectiles and parrying attacks. They are not strong enough to tank strong melee attacks.
<br> The specifics of bucklers are detailed below:

- Bucklers cannot block strong melee attacks. Attempting to use them to block such attacks will quickly destroy the shield.
- Deflecting projectiles like arrows and successfully parrying attacks will not damage the shield
- Parrying requires timing, it is best to put up the shield right before the enemy attacks. Successfully parrying will cause your next attack against the enemy to deal more damage and will restore you some health!
- It *is* possible to parry with a standard shield, however it is much harder to do so, and of course standard shields require BOD.
