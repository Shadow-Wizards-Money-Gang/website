## Version 0.2

### Balance
- Water rats nerfed (sad)
- Rats can now swim underwater, will try to catch some air eventually.
- Baby rats have been reduced, plague rats have been reduced.
- World border radius doubled! (750 radius => 1500 radius)
- Ghouls fight has been tweaked and feels like a proper bossfight now. (no more clipping)
- The Skeleton Beast now spawns more often, deals slightly less damage
- Zotz replace fallen knights as a common enemy, with their sonic attack that bypasses armour and teamwork.
- Fallen Knights spawn very rarely on hordes now.
- Fallen Horses despawn if their masters have despawned
- exp farming penalty reduction reduced.
- Resin:
  - Much cheaper to make, trough crafting it takes one sapling and produces one
  - Can slash trees with a hoe, which risks destroying the block depending on how many slashes are around but slowly releases resin.
  - Arrayan trees will not break from this, and produce it much faster.
  - Using a mortar gives two resin per sapling.
- ZOTZ:
  - They can now spawn in the overworld
  - reduced hp to 24
  - Sonic attacks are reduced when there's too many
  - sonic attacks lose a a percentage of power for each block they go though
  - bite more often than sonic attacks, but increased dmg from each bite

### Bugfixes
- Mixture of crashes from all over the mod
- Strength weapons scaling has been readded and fixed, in a way that makes strength good.

- Fixed keybind issues
- ghoul types not working in modpack
- many, many other things
