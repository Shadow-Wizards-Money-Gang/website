## Version 0.2

General notes bla bla bla cool.

### Balance

- Ghouls fight has been tweaked and feels like a proper bossfight now. (no more clipping)
- Zotz replace fallen knights as a common enemy, with their sonic attack that bypasses armour and teamwork.
- Fallen Knights spawn very rarely on hordes now.
- Fallen Horses despawn if their masters have despawned
- exp farming penalty reduction reduced.
- Resin:
  - Much cheaper to make, trough crafting it takes one sapling and produces one 
  - Can slash trees with a hoe, which risks destroying the block depending on how many slashes are around but slowly releases resin.
  - Arrayan trees will not break from this, and produce it much faster.
  - Using a mortar gives two resin per sapling.
- ZOTZ:
  - They can now spawn in the overworld
  - reduced hp to 20
  - after a certain amount are present, reduce the rate of sonic attacks
  - sonic attacks lose a a percentage of power for each block they go though
  - bite more often than sonic attacks, but increase dmg from each bite
