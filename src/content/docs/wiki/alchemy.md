description: Potions, brews, and alchemical resources
---
Alchemy is one of the key elements of Occultists, and alchemists are quite important to other classes due to their ability to create alchemical resources or powerful potions.

---
Resources
---------
<br>

Various otherwise-unobtainable resources, as well as a few weapons, can be created in the distillery or other alchemical devices.

- Firebrick (Nether Brick)
- Brewwart (Nether Wart)
- Glowstone Dust
- Alkaheist (Dragon's Breath)
- Netherrack
- Blaze Rod; by extent Blaze Powder
- Firebomb
- Magma Cube
- -  Magma Cubes, being mobs and being needed to make Froglights, are obtained by feeding a normal slime a Magma Creme.

---
Potions
---------
<br>
Brewing potions is another key aspect of Alchemists, and their main way of benefiting allies or even battling enemies. However, it works differently than normal.

- Effects of potions are obfuscated to anyone with little or no OCC. You gotta trust your dealer!
- Potions may be dyed, if you need to hide their effects
- Potions are made in the Distillery, but this must be maintained.

Distillery
---------
<br>
The Distillery is the first exclusive unlock of OCC users. It can be used to create both potions and raw items that cannot be obtained otherwise.

**Creating the Distillery**
- Having enough OCC, 9 or more
- Placing a Glass block
- R-clicking on the glass with a Flint and Steel

**Using the Distillery**
- Reagents are placed into the Distillery by r-clicking on the Distillery while holding them, which places them in the device
- Once all reactants are inserted, start the reaction by r-clicking on it with a Flint and Steel.
- It will cook up after a few seconds, but the device must be allowed to cool after. Using the same one too frequently can cause it to overheat and explode! Particles are produced during this cooldown period to help communicate it.
- R-click on it to remove the product after the reaction is complete.
