## Description

The Ashen Drake is a rare and formidable elemental dragon known for its mastery over fire and ash. Its massive body is covered in obsidian-black scales, which constantly smolder and emit embers when it moves. The wings are leathery, lined with glowing veins of molten lava, enabling it to soar through the skies with ease despite its bulk.

The Ashen Drake's eyes burn a deep crimson, often described as two blazing coals, reflecting the molten core of its being. Its breath weapon is a terrifying blast of superheated ash that engulfs its foes in a suffocating cloud, burning and choking them simultaneously.

## Abilities

- **Ash Breath**: Releases a cloud of fiery ash, reducing visibility and scorching anything caught within the area.
- **Immolate**: Can ignite itself to become engulfed in flames, making it hazardous to touch or attack.
- **Lava Summon**: The Ashen Drake can summon pools of lava from the earth to reshape its surroundings or trap enemies.
- **Flight**: Despite its size, the Ashen Drake can fly with surprising speed and agility.

## Behavior

Ashen Drakes are fiercely territorial and prefer to nest near active volcanoes, where they can bask in the heat and feed on the molten flows. They are known to destroy settlements that encroach too closely on their domain, considering any nearby activity a threat to their lairs.

While generally solitary, they have been observed forming loose alliances with fire elementals or other creatures of flame. This cooperation usually benefits both parties by strengthening their hold over a shared volcanic region.

## Weaknesses

- **Water**: The Ashen Drake is vulnerable to water-based attacks or being doused in large amounts of water, which can extinguish its flames and weaken its abilities temporarily.
- **Extreme Cold**: Cold environments sap the Drake's strength, making it sluggish and less capable of using its fire-based powers effectively.
